INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

This is a Django web application and Android mobile application that displays the main web app in a webview, so it cannot function on its own without the web application running on a server. The parameter (mainly "settings.py") need to be changed to your server settings. 

The NLP checker relies on the distributionsWIKI.obj that is too large to upload, so we included the Train_NLP_Corpus.py to generate it. The main system functionality can be found in the views.py.
